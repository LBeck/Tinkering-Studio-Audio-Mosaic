  <h1 class="title"> Reinventing Switches... </h1>
  <p class="intro">There are many ways to make a switch. Here at the Tinkering Studio, making switches is both a collaborative and personal endeavor - visitors inspire and help each other build switches based on their own personal styles, interests, and ideas. They're are always coming up with new ways to involve materials of all shapes, sizes, and origins. To see and hear some of the varieties of switches our visitors invented, click each picture. To learn more about chain reactions, check out the <a href="http://tinkering.exploratorium.edu/chain-reaction">Tinkering Studio site</a>.</p>
